# roonbot

**Note:** I made this about a year ago. My account got banned after getting the login to work lol. Pushing to my snippets in case I use autopy ever again and want to look back at this.

This is an Oldschool Runescape bot written in Python for Linux.

## Setup
Run `roonbot_setup.sh` on a Debian host (VM) that your bot will use.

## Usage
* SSH into your debian host
* Clone the repository
* Run `python roonbot.py`
