Two text games I created in the fall of 2007 when I was first learning how to program at the age of 15. These were made on a Windows 95 PC using QBASIC. I thought this code was lost forever until I was able to recover an old corrupted hard drive using [Zero Assumption Recovery (ZAR)](http://z-a-recovery.com/).
